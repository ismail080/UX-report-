## Overview
This report provides insights derived from usability testing conducted on various tasks within a digital interface. The testing focuses on identifying problem areas based on task success rates and user satisfaction ratings. The data used for analysis includes 150 rows and 9 columns, containing both numeric and text data, with a total of 1350 data points.


## Tools Used:
- Excel
- ChatGPT
- PowerPoint
## Dataset Overview
- Total Rows: 150
- Total Columns: 9
- Number Columns: 6
- Text Columns: 3
### Basic Statistical Operations
Statistical operations were applied to the numeric columns to understand basic trends and correlations within the dataset. A snapshot of the dataset is provided for further analysis.

## Data Charts & Interpretation
#### Key findings from data analysis:

- There is a low correlation between average completion time and average satisfaction rating, with a correlation value of 0.027. This implies that satisfaction does not necessarily depend on how quickly tasks are completed.
- Age and Gender show no significant impact on task performance.
## Problem Identification
The following tasks were identified as having lower-than-average satisfaction ratings and should be areas of focus for improvement:

- Upload Photo
- Download Report
These tasks not only had low satisfaction ratings but also poor task success ratios, indicating a potential usability issue.

## Areas for Further Investigation
Tasks such as Login, Add to Cart, and Contact Support were observed to have high satisfaction ratings but low success ratios. This presents an inconsistency where users are satisfied with the interface but struggle to complete these tasks successfully. Further investigation is needed to understand this discrepancy.

## Conclusion
The usability report highlights key areas for improvement based on task performance and user feedback. Addressing the identified problem areas can significantly enhance user satisfaction and the overall success ratio of critical tasks within the interface.
